This repository is a collection of the tools and scripts I've written to generate
various Tableau visualizations. You can check out my Tableau Public profile here:

## Resources
Here are some interesting resources on using Tableau
* [Data Visualization in Tableau](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-in-tableau--ud1006) (Free Udacity course). When I was just getting started with Tableau I was extremely lost. Taking this course allowed me to get familiar with the basics of how to use the software to create plots and dashboards.
* [Tableau Public How-to videos](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources) (Tableau Public website)
